This is the accompanying jupyter notebook for the book Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka

I have outsourced the data to a dropbox repo so you have to download that folder and install in the repo folder as data. For that, move into your repo root and do this:
`$ curl -L https://www.dropbox.com/s/xb04yz495bzcbje/PythonMachineLearningData.tar.gz?dl=1 && tar -xzf PythonMachineLearningData.tar.gz && mv PythonMachineLearningData data && rm PythonMachineLearningData.tar.gz`
